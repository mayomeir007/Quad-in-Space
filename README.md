3D Desktop GUI - ‘Quad in Space’

‘Quad in Space’ is a Windows application that allows the user to display an image from a file in a 3d space, move it around, stretch it, and also apply effects on it. The user can also save the displayed image, with or without the effects they applied on it. Here are the features described in detail:
‘Load new image’ button adds an image selected from disk onto a quad in 3d space. You can replace the image with a different one by clicking the button again. (NOTE: Supported file types are ‘jpg’, and ‘png’, in formats of one,three, or four color channels).
Use the sliders to change the position, rotation and scale of the image
‘Default position’ button restores the image to its original size and location
You can apply effects on the image: ‘color inversion’ and a two-pass (horizontal and vertical) gaussian blur effect. The slider controls the blur radius (NOTE: the larger the image is, the more time the effect takes, so if you load large images, please be patient with this slider!) 
‘Save image without effects’ button - saves the image with a new given name
‘Save the image with effects’ button saves the image with the effects applied on it.

Have fun :)
